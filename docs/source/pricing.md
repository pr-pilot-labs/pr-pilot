# Pricing

We never liked that almost every AI tool out there is subscription-based. PR Pilot is different.

## Payment Model

PR Pilot is a **credit-based** service. You buy credits and use them to run commands. You decide when and how much money you want to spend.

## Pay as you go

If you run out of credits, you can buy more with simple one-time payments. No subscriptions, no hidden fees.

## Free Tier

Every Github user gets **500 credits for free**. This is enough to run a good amount of commands and get a feel for the service.
